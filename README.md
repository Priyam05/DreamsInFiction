# Dream Identification in Fiction
Dream narratives have been long employed by authors to create gateways into the minds of narrators and characters, as well as alter the surrounding narratives in which they inhabit. Conventional methods like close reading rely on the judgement of the reader to separate dream narratives from non-dream narratives within texts, and this task becomes increasingly involved with large corpus of data. In this project, we present a framework to identify dream reports embedded within fictional narratives via the application of various machine learning models in combination with prevalent dream and literary theories. We explore these methods on three datasets consisting of clinical dream reports, English fiction, and dream reports within fiction. Our results are encouraging as we are able to demarcate dream narratives from other narratives through significant textual markers.
